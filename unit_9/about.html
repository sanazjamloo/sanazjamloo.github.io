 		<p> Sanaz Jamloo is a photographer and researcher based in San Francisco, California. She recieved her MFA in photography with a concentration in conceptual and fine art photography from Academy of Art University in San Francisco. Her photography is a combination of historical research and personal meditation. She also does research on sustainability of memory and the role of photography in reconstructing visual connectivity between the past and present. Sanaz's photographs express a dominance of narration over narrative mainly based upon vernacular images from her past life in Iran, in which the construction of image is more significant than subject matter. It then lends itself to the study of narrativity.  However, the operation of the photograph has a very different character from cinema because it can only offer what initially appears to be a discrete element of the past. Moreover, Sanaz's research also concerns theories of witnessing and commemoration; the role of photography in reconstructing the memory and sorrow, and femininity in contemporary Iranian photography.</p>
